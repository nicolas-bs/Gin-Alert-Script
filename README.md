# Gin-Alert-Script
This project aims to automatize the gin script. Basically, it looks if there's any gib discount in the most well-known Colombian retail stores and send the information by mail.

- `ginebra1` is the script I run in my local machine
- `ginebra2` is the adaptation for the Docker Image
- `requirements` is the list of necessarry libraries
- `Dockerfile` is the setting up for the image creation
